I think I can earn money in udemy by teaching computer programming.
The udemy is similar to hahow , it is global marketplace for learning and teaching online.
The courses in udemy are basic after I browse several courses on the website, I think the purpose of udemy is to teach the beginner.
Besides, maybe I can earn money from it because I saw that there is a course which register number of people are about 800+ , and it should pay 800 dollars by each person so the author may receive 800 * 800 dollars from this course? (but the udemy may get some commission on this course.) 

In conclusion, I like to say that I have developed several projects in my spare time at work, I think that I can arrange some of these projects for teaching in udemy.
