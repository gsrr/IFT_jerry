I want to talk about comic.
我從很小就開始看comic了, 一直到現在,  我還是一直都有在看漫畫.
comic is the part of my life.
我不喜歡看動畫, 因為動畫太吵, 而且無法按照自己的節奏進行觀看.
在經歷過一天的吵雜之後, 我最喜歡的就是一個人靜靜的看著漫畫, 
透過這個動作, 我可以去整理我的思緒, 並且讓我的心情平靜下來.

I want to talk about comics today.
I have read comics from childhood. Until now, I have read comics , comics become the part of my life.
I don't like to watch animation because it is too noisy and it can not be watched by my rhythm.
I like to read comics quietly after a busy day at work because I can calm down and collect my thought by reading comics.
