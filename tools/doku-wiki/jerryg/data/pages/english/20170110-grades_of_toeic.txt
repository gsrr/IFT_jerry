I attended a English test named Toeic in November, but I did not get a good result because my grades was only 590.
It is a little depressed to me. I always think that English ability is important to me, but I do not spend much time to make it better.
I try to learn it, but I did not do it continuously because I felt tired sometimes.
Now it is the moment that I need to improve my English ability for finding a better job.
So I pick up the book and study English again.
