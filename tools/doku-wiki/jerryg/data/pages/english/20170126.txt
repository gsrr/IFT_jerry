I want to talk about something about my job.
在工作上(software developer), 我想很多公司都已經試著將工作自動化, 尤其是外商.
但是在我們公司, 很多動作依然都是靠著人工在進行處理.

I think that many company are try to automate their work(something like build package , test progress, or release progress), especially in foreign company.
but we still do these job manually in my company. 
I think these things are important in developing software although it can not earn money for company.
But it can save a lot of time and improve the quality of software.`

Can you post your sentence.

my company is 23 years old, the manager does not know these things sufficiently.
They still use their old concept to develop a software.

I think there are many things to do, it should do step by step, the first thing I will automate the test process to let the test can run automatically everyday.

we do have man power, even if we does not have, we still should do right things even that is a small step because I think it is a trend due to the scale of software is too big to test manually.

find a way out,
I am trying to find a way out to improve myself.

I am looking for DevOps(developer operation), It is a position to integrate things in develop progress.
I hope that I can become more professional by managing a software. 

Yes, this is the object that this position want to do.

I do not have a detail procedure, i need to know some tools (like ansible, a automated deploy tool), may be I need to spend few months to study these tools.

I think that I can not think very smoothly, I need time to think about what I want to say and translate it.
