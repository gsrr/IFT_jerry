It is a little depressed to me. I always think that English ability is important to me, but I do not spend much time to make it better.
I try to learn it, but I did not do it continuously because I felt tired sometimes.
Now it is the moment that I need to improve my English ability for finding a better job.
So I pick up the book and study English again.";}s:8:"relation";a:1:{s:10:"firstimage";s:0:"";}}s:10:"persistent";a:4:{s:4:"date";a:2:{s:7:"created";i:1484170637;s:8:"modified";i:1484170717;}s:11:"last_change";a:8:{s:4:"date";i:1484170717;s:2:"ip";s:14:"10.141.141.128";s:4:"type";s:1:"E";s:2:"id";s:32:"english:20170110-grades_of_toeic";s:4:"user";s:0:"";s:3:"sum";s:0:"";s:5:"extra";s:0:"";s:10:"sizechange";i:47;}s:4:"user";s:0:"";s:7:"creator";s:0:"";}}
